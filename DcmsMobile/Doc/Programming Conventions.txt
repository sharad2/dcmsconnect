* Add this trace statement to _ViewStart.cshtml so that name of the view becomes part of trace output.

 this.ViewContext.HttpContext.Trace.Write("View Name", this.VirtualPath);


* All scripts should be included at the end of body. If your layout includes scripts, then it is best to create a section called sripts
which your layout should render. Inline scripts are not allowed and should never be necessary.

* Use TextBoxFor() in preference to EditorFor(). This is because we believe that the decision of what control to render should rest with the View, and not with the model.
  Repack prefers EditorFor() because model attributes dictate whether, and how, the control should be displayed. If you are using EditorFor, then you must specify a custom
  edit template because MVC default templates are equivalent to TextBoxFor().

* Each post action must accept the thinnest possible model. This clarifies which POST values are actually expected.

* Magic strings should always be avoided. T4MVC and ReflectionHelper can help with this.

* Use the Controller - Service - repository pattern. Controller should receive ViewModel from view, but it should pass Model to service.
