        OracleDataSource Documentation</h1>
    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    <p>
        OracleDataSource is specifically designed to interact with Oracle 10g database.
        It provides several major features. It derives from <code>SqlDataSource</code> and
        thus inherits all its functionality.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Query Logging </dt>
        <dd>
            Simply by using <code>OracleDataSource</code> instead of <code>SqlDataSource</code>
            you can take advantage of query logging. By default the query log is visible on
            the page. You can set the property <em>RenderLogVisible</em> to false to render
            the log within HTML comments. In this situation the log will be visble only when
            you view the source of the HTML file. You can search for the log by searching for
            the string <code>****</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Server side paging and sorting </dt>
        <dd>
            Any select query you write is automatically transformed into a paging query. It
            retrieves only as many rows as are requested by the associated databound control
            like <code>GridView</code>. Sorting is also performed on the server side by adding
            a suitable order by clause to the query. This works seamlessly for most types of
            queries. More details on this feature are provided in a later section.
            <br />
            <code>HaveParametersChanged</code> property exists to fix a common paging bug encountered
            in applications. Read about it <a href="#HaveParametersChanged">below</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Dynamic query manipulation. </dt>
        <dd>
            Rarely is it possible to have a static SQL query. For example, in searching and
            reporting scenarios you are required to build your where clause dynamically. This
            datasource can assist with this task. The design goal of this feature was to keep
            your queries readable while giving you full power to manipulate them as you want.
            This feature works for update, delete and insert queries as well. <code>CancelSelectOnNullParameter</code>
            defaults to false since we will probably have many null parameters. See <a href="#DynamicQuery">
                below</a> for more details on this feature.
        </dd>
        <dt>Choosing between multiple queries</dt>
        <dd>
            If you have two independent queries and you wish to execute one of them depending
            on the options chosen in your GUI, you can do so easily. For example, you may have
            a Print Selected button as well as a Update selected button. Each button would like
            to execute a different update query. While you could use dynamic queries feature
            to achieve this effect, it quickly gets very cumbersome. A new <code>Queries</code>
            properties has been provided for such circumstances. More details <a href="#MultipleQueries">
                Below</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Stored Procedures</dt>
        <dd>
            Oracle is very finicky about parameters. It raises an error if you bind any parameter
            which is not actually required by the query. This is a big nuisance for dynamic
            queries. For this reason, OracleDataSource parses the resulting query and removes
            unused paramters from the DbCommand object. This strategy fails for Stored Procedures
            because typically you only specify the name. There is no way to detrmine which parameters
            are actually needed by the stored procedure.
            <p>
                OracleDataSource allows you to specify stored procedure name like this: <code>PKG_JF_SRC_2.PKG_JF_SRC_CTN_TKT(:ACARTON_ID,
                    :APRINTER_NAME)</code> or like this: <code>:ReturnParam = PKG_JF_SRC_2.PKG_JF_SRC_CTN_TKT(:ACARTON_ID,
                        :APRINTER_NAME)</code>. This allows us to parse the text and determine which
                parameters are actually needed. Just the function name is passed to Oracle. CommandParsing
                event is not raised for stored procedures. You can also use just the procedure name.
                If there is on open parenthesis in your procedure name, unused parameters are not
                removed.</p>
            <p>
                There can be a scenario where we would like to excecute multiple stored procedures
                at the same time. We need to provide the procedures as follows:</p>
            <br />
            <code>UpdateCommand=" BEGIN<br />
                IFR_ITR.SKUREC_UPDATE(AIntransit_Id =&amp;gt; :AIntransit_Id, ASource_ID =&amp;gt;
                :ASource_ID, AITEM_ID =&amp;gt; :AITEM_ID, ASKU_SIZE =&amp;gt; :ASKU_SIZE, ADIMENSION
                =&amp;gt; :ADIMENSION, AQUANTITY_RECEIVED =&amp;gt; :received_today);
                <br />
                <br />
                PKG_RESV.ADD_TO_IALOC(AIA_ID =&amp;gt; :AIA_ID, ALOCATION_ID =&amp;gt; NULL, AUPC_CODE
                =&amp;gt; :AUPC_CODE, APIECES =&amp;gt; :received_today);
                <br />
                END; " </code>
            <p>
                We need to write the procedures between <b>BEGIN</b> and <b>END</b> blocks.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Transactions </dt>
        <dd>
            Unlike the vanila SqlDataSource, our OracleDatasource provides rich support for
            transactions. You call <code>BeginTransaction</code> any time you want, typically
            before starting your multi row grid update. When you are done with the transaction,
            call <code>CommitTransaction</code> or <code>RollBackTransaction</code>. If an exception
            occurs, and you do not handle it in your <code>Updated</code> event, the transaction
            is automatically rolled back.</dd>
        <dt>CancelSelectOnNullParameter</dt>
        <dd>
            The default value has been changed to false. Also, it only looks at those parameters
            which remain in the query after all command parsing has been done. This means that
            you can have unused null parameters and still expect your query to execute.
        </dd>
        <dt>DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO</dt>
        <dd>
            OracleDataSource also takes the responsibility of setting the module code and action
            using the Oracle <code>DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE</code> function. The module
            code is set to the name of the containing page. The action is simply the ID of the
            datasource. The client info is the name of the authenticated user.
        </dd>
        <dt>Web Methods</dt>
        <dd>
            OracleDataSource includes special features so that it can be conveniently used from
            web methods. <a href="#WebMethods">Details</a>.</dd>
        <dt>Master Detail Scenarios</dt>
        <dd>
            OracleDataSource exposes a <code>PostSelected</code> event in which you are passed
            the enumerable which will be returned to the data source. In this scenario you can
            transform this enumerable as you please to achieve very interesting possibilities.
            See <a href="#PostSelected">PostSelcted Event</a> for an example of how you could
            use this event to implement master detail reports.</dd>
        <dt>CancelSelectOnValidationFailure</dt>
        <dd>
            By default, the query will not execute if the page fails validation. If the page
            is not validated at all, it is not considered to be a failure. This prevents unnecessary
            queries from happening. You can set this property to false if you do not want this
            behavior.</dd>
        <dt>Displaying Query Execution Time</dt>
        <dd>
            You can set the property DisplayExecutionTime to true to see how much time the select
            query took. The output will be displayed on the page whare the data source is located.
            It will say something like &quot;Query took 16.53 seconds&quot;. If the query is
            not executed, nothing is displayed. Additionally, we render the query text and parameter
            values within HTML comments. You can search for this text by viewing the HTML source
            and searching for <code>****</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Capturing Query Execution Times</dt>
        <dd>
            OracleDataSource has the capability to capture the query execution times to the
            database. This feature is available only when DisplayExecutionTime is true. It requires
            that you use the DbProfileProvider. When OracleDataSource detects that this.Context.Profile
            is derived from VisitorProfile, it sets the Metrics property of VisitorProfile to
            reasonable values. XTremeReporter uses this feature extensively.</dd>
        <dt>Array Parameters</dt>
        <dd>
            Within your query, you can enclose any parameter within square brackets. In this
            situation, OracleDataSource will assume that the value is a comma seperated list.
            <a href="#array">More...</a>.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2 id="#array">
        Array Parameters</h2>
    <p>
        You can enable your end user to enter a comma seperated list of values and then
        generate the required query automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, the user is able to enter a comma seperated list of customer ids
        which he is interested in. To achieve this, notice how the query had been defined
        in <code>OracleDataSource</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;oracle:OracleDataSource ID="ds" runat="server" ConnectionString="&lt;%$ ConnectionStrings:dcmslive %&gt;"
ProviderName="&lt;%$ ConnectionStrings:dcmslive.ProviderName %&gt;" SelectCommand="
    SELECT ps.report_status_sequence AS report_status_sequence,
           ...
      FROM rep_active_ps ps, cust cust
     WHERE ps.customer_id = cust.customer_id
           [$<span class="style2">[customer_id]</span>$AND ps.customer_id NOT IN ({0})$]
  GROUP BY ..." CancelSelectOnNullParameter="true"&gt;
&lt;SelectParameters&gt;
    ...
    &lt;asp:ControlParameter ControlID="tbCustomers" Type="String" Direction="Input" Name="customer_id" DbType=&quot;String&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/SelectParameters&gt;
&lt;/oracle:OracleDataSource&gt;  </pre>
    <p>
        We have enclosed the customer_id parameter within square brackets. Now if the user
        enters c1, c2 in the text box, the resulting where clause would be <code>AND ps.customer_id
            NOT IN (:customer_id0, :customer_id1)</code>. This was achieved by replacing
        the place holder {0} with <code>:customer_id0, :customer_id1.</code> The parameters
        customer_id0 and customer_id1 will be automatically added and their values would
        be c1 and c2 respectively. The Type of these paramaeters would always be String
        but the DbType should be set to the actual type of each value in the array. be the
        same as the type you have specified for the ControlParameter whose name is customer_id,
        i.e. in this example: String.
    </p>
    <p>
        16 Oct 2009: You can optionally specify a condition immediately after the array
        parameter. The clause will be ignored if the condition evaluates to false. Example:
        Use the clause only if the pritnt_what parameter cotains P.</p>
    <pre>
[$[ucc_id_list]contains(:print_what, 'P')$           
...
WHERE ucc_id IN ({0})
...
$]
</pre>
    <p>
        Sharad 24 Sep 2010: You can specify a seperator after the array parameter.
        <code>[$[term, OR ]$ms.style LIKE '%' || {0} || '%'$]</code> results in:
    </p>
    <pre>
ms.style LIKE '%' || :style0 || '%' OR ms.style LIKE '%' || :style1 || '%'        
        </pre>
        <p>
        If there are n comma seperated values in the string parameter style, then the clause specified by you is repeated
        n times.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here is a comprehensive example from the SKU autocomplete web method.
        </p>
        <pre>
             WITH all_sku AS
             (SELECT ms.upc_code AS upc_code,
                     ms.style AS style,
                     ms.color AS color,
                     ms.dimension AS dimension,
                     ms.sku_size AS sku_size,
                     [$[term, + ]$

    <h2>
        Server Side Sorting</h2>
    <p>
        Server side sorting is invoked when a data bound control requests sorting. This
        usually happens when the user clicks on the column of a grid. OracleDataSource appends
        an ORDER BY clause to your query using the sort expression passed by the control
        . This implies that your query should not already have an ORDER BY clause. Instead,
        specify the initial sort expression as the value of the property DefaultSortExpression.</p>
    <pre>
 &lt;dcms:OracleDataSource ID="dsStyle" runat="server" <span class="style1">DefaultSortExpression=&quot;STYLE&quot;</span> SelectCommand="
SELECT
	STYLE,
        max(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN) as WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN,
        min(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN) as Minweight,
        Max(VOLUME_PER_DOZEN) as VOLUME_PER_DOZEN,
        min(VOLUME_PER_DOZEN) as MinVolume,
        Count(Style) as TotalSKU
FROM MASTER_SKU
WHERE ...
GROUP BY STYLE
" /&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        Notice that we have specified the <code>DefaultSortExpression</code> property. This
        is required for server side sorting to work properly. It tells the data source what
        order by clause should be constructed by default. If you forget to specify this
        property, a runtime exception will be generated.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;This datasource is associated with a <code>GridView</code> which looks like
        this:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;asp:GridView ID="gvStyle" runat="server" AutoGenerateColumns="False" DataSourceID="dsStyle" AllowSorting="true"&gt;
    &lt;Columns&gt;
        &lt;asp:BoundField DataField="row_sequence" /&gt;
        &lt;asp:TemplateField HeaderText="Style" SortExpression="STYLE"&gt;
            ....
        &lt;/asp:TemplateField&gt;
        &lt;asp:BoundField HeaderText="Total SKU" DataField="TotalSKU" <span class="style1">
            SortExpression=&quot;TotalSKU"</span> /&gt;
        &lt;asp:TemplateField HeaderText="Weight (Lbs/dozen)" <span class="style1">SortExpression=&quot;max(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN)"</span>&gt;
            ....
        &lt;/asp:TemplateField&gt;
    &lt;/Columns&gt;
&lt;/asp:GridView&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
        When the grid is initially rendered, the generated query looks like this:</p>
    <pre> select STYLE,
       max(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN) as WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN,
       min(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN) as Minweight,
       Max(VOLUME_PER_DOZEN) as VOLUME_PER_DOZEN,
       min(VOLUME_PER_DOZEN) as MinVolume,
       Count(Style) as TotalSKU
  from MASTER_SKU
  WHERE ...
GROUP BY style
<span class="style1">ORDER BY style</span></pre>
    <p>
        The ORDER BY clause has been added by OracleDataSource using the DefaultSortExpression
        you specifed.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;When the user clicks on a column of the grid view, the sort expression is
        passed to this data source. In this case, the passed sort expression is used instead
        of the default sort expression. As you can see, the sort expression is changing
        dynamically without any coding on your part.</p>
    <h2>
        Server Side Paging</h2>
    <p>
        When you allow paging for a grid view, the grid passes to the data source the start
        row index and max rows to retrieve. Using these passed values, your query is automatically
        transformed to retrieve only the rows needed. The transformed query looks like this:</p>
    <pre>  WITH OriginalQuery AS (SELECT STYLE,
                             max(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN) as WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN,
                             min(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN) as Minweight,
                             Max(VOLUME_PER_DOZEN) as VOLUME_PER_DOZEN,
                             min(VOLUME_PER_DOZEN) as MinVolume,
                             Count(Style) as TotalSKU      
                       from MASTER_SKU
                      WHERE ...
                   GROUP BY style),
      PagedQuery AS (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() over(order by {1}) AS row_sequence, COUNT(*) OVER() AS RowCount_, t.* FROM OriginalQuery t )
SELECT *
  FROM PagedQuery
 <span class="style2">WHERE row_sequence >= :first_row AND row_sequence < :last_row ORDER
     BY row_sequence</span>
</pre>
    <p>
        Your original query becomes a WITH query. The highlighted WHERE and ORDER BY clause
        added by OracleDataSource is responsible for ensuring that only the desired number
        of rows are retrieved. During paging, the grid also needs to know the total number
        of qualifying rows. This is retrieved as the RowCount_ column of your query. OracleDataSource
        peeks at the first row and returns the value of TotalRowCount to the data bound
        control via select arguments.</p>
    <p>
        You query may also contain a WITH clause. OracleDataSource is intelligent about
        this and transforms the query appropriately.
    </p>
    <pre>  WITH <span class="style2">your-with-clauses,</span>
      OriginalQuery AS (SELECT STYLE,
                             max(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN) as WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN,
                             min(WEIGHT_PER_DOZEN) as Minweight,
                             Max(VOLUME_PER_DOZEN) as VOLUME_PER_DOZEN,
                             min(VOLUME_PER_DOZEN) as MinVolume,

        You can incorporate dynamic blocks of text within your query. This is useful for
        building your where clause dynamically. Consider the following select command. The
        dynamic portion of the where clause is incorporated using the pattern <code>[$function$clause$]</code>

        which depend on missing_wieghts_only and missing_volumes only parameters. The CustomCondition
        clause represents a custom condition (because there is no : within it). You must
        evaluate this condition in the <code>CommandParsing</code> event handler. It receives
        the function name and the clause as an argument. If you want to keep the where clause
        set e.Action to CommandParsingAction.UseClause, otherwise set it to CommandParsingAction.IgnoreClause.
        You can even modify the where clause by setting an appropriate value for e.ReplacementString</p>

    <p>
        In the above example we have three queries whose ids are <code>updateSelected, updateAll
            and printSelected</code>. We need to execute one of these as the UpdateCommand,
        depending on the option chosen by our user. Notice that we have not specified the
        UpdateCommand.
    </p>
    <p>
        The strategy is to handle the <code>Updating</code> event and set the <code>CommandText</code>
        of the passed <code>DbCommand</code> to one of these queries. Here is a sample Updating
        event handler.
    </p>

    <p>
        The tab control doesn't identify the web controls placed inside it when the tab
        control exist independently on a page. But there are situations where we need to
        use it. for eg: To seperate multiple filters in a page in different groups. So,
        to overcome this shortfall we have to write the control parameters that inherit
        the custom class ControlParameterEx as below:

        Here, in NamingPath property, the first part before '/' refers to the name of the
        TabContainer and the second part refers to the TabPanel wherein exist that control.

        controls place inside it.

        Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        Here is an example of how you might use transactions. We want to update multiple
        rows of a GridView control but would like to ensure that all updates happen within
        a single transaction. This is achieved by first, calling <code>dsSize.BeginTransaction()</code>.
        The we update each row of the grid. Finally we call <code>dsSize.CommitTransaction()</code>.
        Notice that we did not have to worry about rolling back the transaction because
        OracleDataSource guarantees that the transaction will be rolled back if any exception
        occurs.
    </p>
    <pre>
private void CreateCartons()
{
    // dsSize is an instance of OracleDataSource
    <span class="style2">dsSize.BeginTransaction</span>();
    _curCartonId = DBNull.Value;
    foreach (GridViewRow row in gvSize.Rows)
    {
        TextBox tb = (TextBox)row.FindControl("tbPieces");
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(tb.Text))
        {
            gvSize.UpdateRow(row.RowIndex, false);
        }
    }
    <span class="style2">dsSize.CommitTransaction</span>();
}
</pre>
    <h2 id="HaveParametersChanged">
        HaveParametersChanged Property</h2>
    <p>
        When server side paging is involved and you are using automatic databinding, you
        need to be aware of a bug which may be faced by your application. Automatic databinding
        means that you have assigned a DatasourceID to your GridView. Consider this setup:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your application displays filter text boxes in which the user can input values.
        </li>
        <li>You use ControlParameters which retrieve values from these textboxes directly.
        </li>
        <li>You are using a grid view which is bound to an OracleDataSource using the DatasourceID
            property. </li>
        <li>AllowPaging has been set to true for the GridView. </li>
        <li>The grid is currently displaying some data. The data consists of multiple pages
            and let us say that the first page is being displayed. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Given this setup, assume that the user changes one of the filter values such that
        the resulting rows will fit within one gridview page. Ideally he should have pressed
        your Apply Filters button to see these rows. Let us suppose he forgets to do that
        and instead clicks on page 3 icon of the grid. When the Page 3 icon is clicked,
        the following sequence of events happen:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a postback occurs </li>
        <li>the grid rebinds because the parameters have changed </li>
        <li>The grid attempts to show the third page. Since the resultset is only one page long,
            the grid does not display anything. This will be very surprising for the user.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To work around this situation, OracleDataSource provides the <code>HaveParametersChanged</code>
        property. This is an advanced property and returns useful information only after
        LoadComplete event of the page has fired. In your page class, you must override
        the OnLoadComplete method and write code similar to this:
    </p>
    <pre>
protected override void OnLoadComplete(EventArgs e)
{
    // Must call base class first so that the LoadComplete event fires.
    base.OnLoadComplete(e);

    // Ask OracleDataSource whether any parameters have changed. If yes, then set the PageIndex of the grid to 0.
    if (dsCartonList.HaveParametersChanged)
    {
        gvCartonList.PageIndex = 0;
    }
}
</pre>
    <p>
        This bug is not the fault of OracleDataSource. It is the fault of Microsoft's data
        binding architecture. You will experience this bug with any datasource. OracleDataSource
        is nice enough to provide you with a way to work around this bug.
    </p>
    <h2 id="WebMethods">
        Using OracleDataSource in Web Methods</h2>
    <p>
        It is very useful to use OracleDataSource in your static web methods. It leads to
        much cleaner code compared to creating the OracleCommand object yourself and adding
        parameters to it. To access the values of your out parameters, you would normally
        handle the Updated event and read the values there. However, this is very inconvenient
        in a web method since you cannot store the return values in a member variable. To
        help with this situation, OracleDataSource provides the <code>OutValues</code> property.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following example, we call a stored procedure to print the wave summary report
        and then find out how may copies were printed by accessing the return value of the
        function.
    </p>
    <pre>
[WebMethod]
public static int PrintBucketSummary(int bucketId, string printerName)
{
    int nCopiesPrinted;
    using (OracleDataSource ds = new OracleDataSource())
    {
        ds.ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["dcms8"].ConnectionString;
        ds.ProviderName = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["dcms8"].ProviderName;
        ds.UpdateCommand = "PKG_PRINT_PD.WRITE_BUCKET_SUMMARY_TO_FILE";
        ds.UpdateCommandType = SqlDataSourceCommandType.StoredProcedure;

        ds.UpdateParameters.Add("abucket_id", TypeCode.Int32, bucketId.ToString());
        ds.UpdateParameters.Add("aprinter_name", TypeCode.String, printerName);
        ds.UpdateParameters.Add("acopies", TypeCode.Int32, NUMBER_OF_COPIES.ToString());
        Parameter paramCopiesPrinted = new Parameter("ReturnParam", TypeCode.Int32);
        ds.UpdateParameters.Add(paramCopiesPrinted);
        paramCopiesPrinted.Direction = ParameterDirection.ReturnValue;
        ds.Update();
        nCopiesPrinted = Convert.ToInt32(ds.OutValues["ReturnParam"]);
    }
    return nCopiesPrinted;
}
</pre>
    <h2 id="PostSelected">
        PostSelected Event</h2>
    <p>
        This is an advanced event which is always raised after the <code>Selected</code>
        event. In this event you are passed the enumerable which will be returned to the
        datasource. You can replace this enumerable with your own iterator thereby transofrming
        the data returned to the data bound control.</p>
    <p>
        This event is always guaranteed to occur. This means that it is raised even if the
        query is cancelled during the Selecting event, or an exception occurs during the
        selection. When a query has not been performed,. e.Result contains null. You can
        use this information to update the EmptyDataText of your grid. For example, if a
        query has not happened, you might want to not display the empty template. If the
        query has happened, you may want to say &quot;No rows found&quot;.</p>
    <pre>
protected void dsPickSlipForPO_PostSelected(object sender, PostSelectedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Result == null)
    {
        gv.EmptyDataText = "";
    }
    else
    {
        gv.EmptyDataText = "No rows found";
    }
}        
</pre>
    <p>
        This example describes how you can use the <code>PostSelected</code> event to implement
        master detail using a single query. Our goal is to display one table per operation
        code. To do this we have a repeater which displays information about the operation
        code. Each item in the repeater contains a <code>GridView</code> which displays
        the details of that operation code.

        TypeCode.String, value) Type code must be specified otherwise exception thrown.
        If you provide the any custom field, you must set the ContextPackeageName property
        to Package name which manipulate the context. e.g.
    </p>
    <pre>
ContextPackeageName= “pkg_inventory_context”; 

Following are some useful custom field use by the developer. 
1-	Group_id (mandatory
Write the following code to set the group_id
ds.SysContext.ContextParameters.Add ("group_id", TypeCode.String, null)
Value for group_id must be null otherwise exception thrown. </pre>
    <p>
        You can also set group_id in design time as described below.
    </p>
    <pre>
          &lt;syscontext contextpackagename="PKG_INVENTORY_CONTEXT" clientinfo="Adjusting carton contents"&gt;
            &lt;ContextParameters&gt;
             &lt;eclipse:UserParameter Name="app_user" Type="String" ConvertEmptyStringToNull="true" /&gt;
             &lt;asp:Parameter Name="group_id" Type="String" ConvertEmptyStringToNull="true" /&gt;
            &lt;/ContextParameters&gt;
          &lt;/syscontext&gt;
</pre>
    <pre>
    
2 APP_User:
App_user should be set to the application user. 

ProcedureFormatString:
This property build the query to call the procedure that manipulate the context value

By Default this property has the value 
set_{0}(A{0} => :{0}, client_id => :client_id);
where {0} is replaced by context parameter name.   
If you have a ContextParameter named pickslip_id, its value will be set using the call
CustomContextPackage.set_pickslip_id(Apickslip_id => :pickslip_id);
</pre>
    <pre> 
 Example:

Suppose we receive the carton then we set the context in the following manner.


ds.SysContext.Action = "Transfering Carton";
ds.SysContext.ModuleName = "CartonTransfer";
ds.SysContext.ClientInfo = userName;
ds.SysContext.ContextPackageName = "pkg_inventory_context";
ds.SysContext.ContextParameters.Add("Intransit_Id", TypeCode.String, this.IntransitId);
ds.SysContext.ContextParameters.Add("app_user", TypeCode.String, userName);
                ds.SysContext.ContextParameters.Add("Group_Id",TypeCode.Int32, null);



If you use the transaction,set these context value at the begning of transaction so that same value goes for a group.                  

    </pre>
    <h4>
        Some useful code examples:</h4>
    <pre>In this example user can either enter rma_id or rma_number through GUI but the backend package accepts 
rma_id to update rma. Therefore, we queried the database for rma_id when user entered rma_number.</pre>
    <pre> ,</pre>
    <pre>
UpdateCommand="BEGIN
IF :rma_id IS NULL THEN
    select rma.rma_id
    INTO :rma_id
    from rma rma
    where rma.rma_number = :rma_number ;    
    END IF; 
    receive_return_sku(arma_id   =&gt; :rma_id,
                     aupc_code =&gt; :UPC,
                     apieces   =&gt; :pieces_Today);  
                     :rma_id := :rma_id;                 
END;"
</pre>
    <p>
        But the drawback of above PL/SQL block is that rma_id will always be queried for
        each update command. Therfore, we first time the update command is fired we get
        the value in the updated event of datasource in a page variable. Now because the
        rma_id will remain same for entire transaction we set it in updating event the next
        time around. See below for sample code.
    </p>
    <pre>
         private object _curRmaId;
        protected void dsSKU_Updating(object sender, SqlDataSourceCommandEventArgs e)
        {
            if (_curRmaId != null)
            {
                e.Command.Parameters["rma_id"].Value = _curRmaId;
            }
        }

        protected void dsSKU_Updated(object sender, SqlDataSourceStatusEventArgs e)
        {
            if (e.Exception == null)
            {
                if (e.Command.Parameters["rma_id"].Value != null)
                {
                    _curRmaId = e.Command.Parameters["rma_id"].Value;
                }
            }
        }
           </pre>

        OracleDataSource helps you in managing your status messages. Example given below
        has a PL/SQL block which calls two pacakges to print pickslip and wave summary.You
        would like to show messages like &quot;2 pickslips printed on laser4c printer&quot;
        after the operation is completed. Just enclose your message within /** */ in the
