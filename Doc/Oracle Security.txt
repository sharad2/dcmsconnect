Thanks to OracleDataStore, Oracle Proxy users are supported. The connect string can look like this:
<add name="dcms8" connectionString="Data Source=w8bhutan/mfdev;Persist Security Info=True;Proxy User Id=dcms8;Proxy Password=dcms8"  />

If the user is not logged in, then the connect string will behave equivalent to the non proxy counterpart:
<add name="dcms8" connectionString="Data Source=w8bhutan/mfdev;Persist Security Info=True;User Id=dcms8;Password=dcms8"  />

If the user is logged in, then the program executes as the logged in user. The logged in user must have rights on all tables as required by the
program being used.

As a special case, if logged in user is same as proxy user, the proxy infrastructure is bypassed. This is necessary to prvent errors like
"dcms8 cannot connect as dcms8".

dcms4 and dcms8 should be assigned the flag role DCMS_DBA. This role need not have any rights assigned to it sice we do not intend to assign it to any user other than
dcm4 and dcms8. All authorization restrictions must ensure that DCMS_DBA role is allowed to perform the task.
