	<h1>OraclemembershipProvider</h1>
	<p>
	Provides login services where each user is authenticated by attempting to connect to an Oracle database
	using the supplied username and password. If the oracle login succeeds, then the user is authenticated.
	To use this provider, you web.config must have the following entry:
	</p>
	<pre>
&lt;membership defaultProvider="OracleMembershipProvider"&gt;
  &lt;providers&gt;
    &lt;clear/&gt;
    &lt;add name ="OracleMembershipProvider" type="EclipseLibrary.Oracle.Web.Security.OracleMembershipProvider"
       connectStringName=&quot;dcms4&quot; oracleServiceName="w3usa/dcdev"/&gt;
  &lt;/providers&gt;
&lt;/membership&gt;</pre>
	    <p>
            connectStringName property refers to a connection string defined in the 
            connectionStrings section of web.config. The user name and password of the 
            connection string is not used because the user name and password of the user 
            attempting to login is used. All other properties are used, includind the 
            ProviderName property.</p>
        <p>
            oracleServiceName property is deprecated and should not be used by new 
            applications.</p>
