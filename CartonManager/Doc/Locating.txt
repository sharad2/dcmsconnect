Locating Speicifications (By Rajesh 11 Jul 2012)
------------------------------------------------
Scenerio 1: Most common case : Cartons need to be located.
        - Show some empty locations area wise at application start up
	- Scan Location. The Location should be available. Location is empty. 
	- Scan Carton. Carton can belong to any area but it should be valid(It should exist). Notify if carton is    already on scanned location
	- Repeat Location-Carton 


Scenario 2: Location is not Empty
- Show some empty locations area wise at application start up
- Scan Location. The Location should be available. Location already has cartons. Display area of location also.	
- prompt user to enter correct count of cartons at location.
- If there's mis-match between actula count and input count , ask for re-entry of carton count.
- In case mis-match set last_cyc_date to null in src_carton against scanned location.
- Scan Carton. Carton can belong to any area but it should be valid(It should exist). Notify if carton is already on scanned location

- Scan Next location and repeat.

Scenario 3: Scan Pallet
- Scan pallet. Show carton count on location.Put all cartons in suspense.
- Rest steps similar with that of scenario 1 and 2.


Old Locating Specification
-------------------------------------
Scenario 1: Cartons on a pallet need to be located at individual locations.

- Scan Pallet. The pallet must have some cartons on it. Carton count is displayed. Pallet scan is useful so that we can 
			   identify cartons which have been accidentally put on pallet.
- Scan Location. Accepts only BIR Locations. Count of cartons on Location displayed.
- Scan Carton. Warning if carton is not on scanned pallet. After confirmation it locates carton at specified location.

- Repeat Location-Carton.

Suspense feature- Warning if you quit from the apllication. If quit, all remaining cartons on the pallet put in suspense.

Scenario 2: Ability to locate entire pallet at the same location. 

Scenario 3: Locate cartons individually

-Scan location -If valid proceed
-Scan carton - Locate scanned carton. warn if carton does not belong to AWL , locate it after confirmation.
 





Notes:Need to discuss
------
What about sounds?

Should we put carton in suspense?

Should we warn if carton is not in AWL.?
--- Why can't carton belonging to any area be located.Why AWL is special.....
--- Current locating locates carton even if we don't scan pallet first. Scenario 1
--- Locate cartons on a pallet individually. Scenario 2.

---Old Locating provides pallet locating in two ways
1.Either locate whole pallet in one go
2.Locate each carton on pallet individually.
