1. In what order are SKUs replenished?

The replenishment priority of the SKU is based on bucket priority.
 - SKUs marked high my user or create mpc are top in the list. This priority is ephemeral. It automatically reverts back to normal 2 hrs after it was last tweaked.
 - Next Max priority of each under process bucket to which the SKU belongs. More buckets an SKU belongs to, higher its priority.
  An under process bucket is a bucket whose picking can begin and has not yet completed.
 - Next is the number of buckets an SKU belongs to.


 Location priority is ephemeral. It automatically reverts back to normal 2 hrs after it was last tweaked.

When SKUs are selected for replenishment, they are ordered by 
 - User specified location priority
 - CreateMpc specified location priority
 - User Specified Bucket priority.


The location priority is stored in the database in ialoc.replenish_priority NUMBER(4) column. It is interpreted as bits. 
The first bit is manipulated by CreateMpc. The second bit is manipulated by the User. 
Virtual Columns ialoc.user_priority (= TRUNC(ialoc.replenish_priority / 2))
and ialoc.mpc_priority (= MOD(ialoc.replenish_priority, 2)) have been added which provide access to each bit.

ialoc.replenish_priority  ialoc.user_priority  ialoc.mpc_priority
0                            0                      0
1 =(B01)                     0                      1
2 =(B10)                     1                      0
3 =(B11)                     1                      1

To update ialoc.replenishment_user_priority to x
update ialoc
set replenish_priority = 2 * x + NVL(replenishment_mpc_priority,0)

To update ialoc.replenishment_mpc_priority to x
update ialoc
set replenish_priority = x + NVL(replenishment_user_priority * 2,0)

CreateMPC should not touch priority, if user priority is already high. This prevents unnecessarily extending the expiry of user priority.

------------------
The cartons assigned to pullers are maintained in temp_pull_carton. These cartons are expired whenever the suggestion materialized view is refreshed.
The expiration is sliding. Each time we suggest, the expiry is set to 30 min from now.

Sharad 23 Aug 2012: Skipping carton
-----------------------------------
To skip a carton, the puller can scan the location. After confirmation, we will put all cartons at that location suspense.

Suggested carton gets pulled by someone else: It will be removed from this puller's list and the puller will be suggested another carton. If this new carton happens to be behind the puller's current
position, back tracking could become necessary.
